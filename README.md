## INTRODUCTION

Were you a fan of my custom figurine but too lazy to make your own pawns? Well now you don't have to!

Presenting Rokem's Pathfinder Bestiary #1 Pawn Pack! I have searched far and wide for the original high-res image for every single pawn in this pack. Unfortunately some images were not great quality and I could not find anything better. If you happen to own these pawns IRL and would like to contribute a high-res image, I will happily update this mod.


I'd appreciate it if you drop a comment below. Enjoy!
  
## CHANGELOG
3/19/2020 - Initial release!

Special shout out to Tiberius! I was able to use his mod as a reference to find all the images used in this pack. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=694379428&searchtext=pathfinder
