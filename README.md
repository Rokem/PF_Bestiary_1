# INTRODUCTION

Were you a fan of my custom figurine but too lazy to make your own pawns? Well now you don't have to! Presenting Rokem's Pathfinder Bestiary #1 Pawn Pack using my [custom figurine model](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=891993501) specially sized for 1x1 grids!

I have searched far and wide for the original high-res image of every single pawn in this pack. Unfortunately, I could not find high-quality versions of some tokens, and I either had to use a lower-res image or use a different image entirely. Because of this, this pack is not a 100% 1-to-1 recreation of the original Paizo box. In addition to sourcing high-res images wherever possible, I also added full transparency to every image and minimized cropping as much as possible. For wide images (dragons for example), I used the 2x1 wide base token so you may fully enjoy these beasts in all their majesty!

Finally, all pawns are sized according to the creature's size with a 1x1 grid size corresponding to a medium sized creature. Small size creatures also use a 1x1 grid, but have been "sized down" in the actual image template while any creatures smaller than small are all fixed at to a .5x.5 grid size (going any smaller and the token just becomes impossible to see). Larger creatures size up accordingly (2x2 for large, 3x3 for huge, and so on).

If you happen to own these pawns IRL and would like to contribute a high-res image to this pack, provide me a link in the comments below and I'll add your credit and handle the rest!

I hope you enjoy these pawns in your next RPG session and don't forget to give a thumbs up and drop a comment below with your thoughts! Enjoy! :D


### Future Plans
It took a very long time to compile all the images, generate the transparencies, create the templates, then finally import and size everything properly in Tabletop Simulator. I am planning on releasing more pawn packs, however please understand it will be some time before the next one is ready.

The next planned pack will be an NPC pawn pack to help populate your towns and villages. Stay tuned!

## Credit
Special shout out to Tiberius for his [Pathfinder Bestiary 1 Pawn pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=694379428)! I was able to use his mod as a reference to find all the images used in this pack. Be sure to give him a thumbs up!
